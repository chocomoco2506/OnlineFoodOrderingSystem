# OnlineFoodOrderingSystem
JavaScript
Developed a dynamic Food Ordering System using JavaScript to streamline the process of ordering meals from six popular restaurants in Pathein. Implemented a user-friendly front-end interface for seamless menu browsing, order placement, and payment processing. Utilized back-end functionalities to manage order data, restaurant inventory, and real-time updates, ensuring a smooth and efficient user experience. This project enhanced my skills in full-stack JavaScript development and problem-solving for real-world applications.
